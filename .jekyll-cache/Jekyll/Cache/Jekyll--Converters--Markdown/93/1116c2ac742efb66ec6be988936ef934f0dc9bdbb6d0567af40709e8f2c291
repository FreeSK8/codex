<h3 id="esc-packet-status">ESC Packet Status</h3>

<p>As ESC data is received by Robogotchi the circle icon will move left and right. If a circle does not appear or is not moving there is trouble communicating with the ESC.</p>

<p>Robogotchi automatically determines if the TX and RX wires are switched and will adjust every 3 seconds.</p>

<h3 id="gps-data-status">GPS Data Status</h3>

<p>The value after GPS is updated with the seconds of the minute as seen from the GPS module. The uBlox module shipping with the beta units may report a value of 247 until a satellite signal is acquired.</p>

<p>Typically you would expect to see this update once a second with the current second of the minute.</p>

<h3 id="gps-signal-status">GPS Signal Status</h3>

<p>Two digits after the S represent the GPS status being valid and of good quality. 
The first digit can be a 0 or a 1 with 1 meaning the GPS status is valid.
The second digit can be 0,1,2 with 1 and 2 meaning the GPS fix is valid.</p>

<p>If this reads S00 make sure your GPS has a clear view of the sky and wait a few minutes for the signal to be acquired.</p>

<p>Robogotchi will play audio tones when the GPS signal becomes valid or is lost.</p>

<h3 id="esc-fault-indicator">ESC Fault Indicator</h3>

<p>This displays the number of fault types Robogotchi has received from the ESC(s) this session. A value of F00 indicates all is well.</p>

<p>A history of fault codes received are stored in memory while all faults are saved to the log files.</p>

<p>Robogotchi will play audio tones when a fault is observed.</p>

<h3 id="filesystem-free-space-">Filesystem free space %</h3>

<p>As log files are saved to Robogotchi the available storage space is monitored.</p>

<p>Robogotchi will play audio tones when storage reaches a user defined limit.</p>

<h3 id="logging-in-progress-indicator">Logging in progress indicator</h3>

<p>This will display Log active when Robogotchi is saving data to itâ€™s internal storage.</p>

<h3 id="number-of-files-saved-on-robogotchi">Number of files saved on Robogotchi</h3>

<p>Each log is counted as 1 file and will remain on Robogotchi until a Sync operation is performed in the FreeSK8 Mobile companion application.</p>
