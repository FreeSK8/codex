## Throttle Lock

To prevent unwanted throttle input while your OSRR is powered on the Throttle Lock feature can be used. This feature does not timeout and will not deactivate if signal is lost. You must disable the lock manually or power off the OSRR.

### Activation

Quickly double pressing the User Button will toggle Throttle Lock. Once activated; the OSRR does not accept user input to the throttle, an audio alert is played and the display will indicate the OSRR currently locked. 
A neutral (center stick) throttle signal is sent until Throttle Lock is disabled.
