## Quick Pair

#### Recommended procedure for pairing:

  1. Activate Pairing by holding down the User Button while powering on the OSRR.
  2. Power on your Receiver.
  3. Review the on screen status. Typically paired in under 10 seconds.

#### Notes:
  1. Activing Pairing on the OSRR will break the bond with the previous Receiver.
  2. Powering on the OSRR before your Receiver/Vehicle is recommended to prevent unauthorized pairing attempts.
  3. Pairing is only active on the Receiver when initially powered on and not receiving a signal from the OSRR.
  4. If Pairing requires more than 10 seconds please try moving the OSRR closer to the Receiver.
