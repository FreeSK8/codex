# FreeSK8 Robogotchi

The [FreeSK8 Robogotchi](https://derelictrobot.com/collections/production/products/freesk8-robogotchi) is an advanced BLE Receiver, Datalogger, and core component of the FreeSK8 System.

Think of it like a blackbox flight recorder for your esk8 or LEV. 

The Robogotchi brings Always-On Logging as a core feature with an asynchronous logging integration with our FreeSK8 Mobile App. 

Ride now, Sync later.
