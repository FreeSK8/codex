#### Overlay

The [Overlay Tool](https://overlay.freesk8.dev/) allows you to take your FreeSK8 data and add it to your videos using the Garmin [VIRB Edit](https://www8.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=6591) software. Some of you likely have used this before but in case you haven't the software is for Windows based computers and free to download. You can use video from essentially any camera and overlay custom gauges.

For best results this is what we've learned:

Start recording video first. Record yourself pressing the "Start Log" button in the FreeSK8 application. Make sure you have GPS signal before you start. GPS is required for Garmin.

* Open video in VIRB
* Import G-Metrix (the FIT file)
* Use Sync option in VIRB to find yourself pressing "Start Log"
* Add gauges!
