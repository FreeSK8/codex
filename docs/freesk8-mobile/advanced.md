# Advanced

Sometimes, just knowing your battery voltage isn't enough. If you are an avid user there is a possibility you'd like to explore some of the advanced features of the application. 

## [TCP Bridge]({{ '/' | absolute_url }}docs/freesk8-mobile/advanced/tcp-bridge)

The TCP Bridge will allow you to connect to your ESC from other applications like vesc-tool via FreeSK8 Mobileâ€™s Bluetooth connection.

## [Data Backups]({{ '/' | absolute_url }}docs/freesk8-mobile/advanced/data-backup)

Data backups are a great way to keep an archive of the trips you've taken and vehicles you've connected to in the past.

## [Vehicle Manager]({{ '/' | absolute_url }}docs/freesk8-mobile/advanced/vehicle-manager)

The vehicle manager displays a list of previous connections allowing you to modify or remove vehicles from the application.

## [Debug Log]({{ '/' | absolute_url }}docs/freesk8-mobile/advanced/debug-log)

If something isn't working as expected we've enabled an in-application debug log viewer.
