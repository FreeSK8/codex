## Connected Vehicle Status Screen

Upon connection to a previously saved device you'll see this status screen.

![Connected Vehicle Status Screen]({{ '/' | absolute_url }}assets/images/mobileapp/status.png)

Robogotchi users will see an extra bar across the top with Logging, Faults, Alerts and GPS status information. 

The logging column shows if data is currently being saved, the number of files on the device and how much storage space is remaining. Tapping this section will navigate to [Ride Logging]({{ '/' | absolute_url }}docs/freesk8-mobile/ride-logging/)

## Next Steps: 

Once connected there is much you can do. Here are a few good topics to get you going...
