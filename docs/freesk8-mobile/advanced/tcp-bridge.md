## TCP Bridge

The TCP Bridge can be enabled in the menu once connected to an ESC. This will allow you to connect to your ESC from other applications like vesc-tool via FreeSK8 Mobileâ€™s Bluetooth connection. Your phone must be connected to WiFi and have an IPv4 address to use this feature. Once enabled your IP will be presented.
